#********************************************************************************************
#starting layout and code for sending email notifications for air quality warnings 
#WARNING: totally psuedo code does not run just testing layout and ideas and stuff 
#have a working file that just sends emails does not include psuedo code for the AQI
#tutorials followed:
# 	https://medium.freecodecamp.org/send-emails-using-code-4fcea9df63f
#********************************************************************************************

#our email info TBD idk if anyone has a prefered platform/way to execute this 
#if not i will likely use gmail which i have in the working file 
MY_ADDRESS = 'email'
PASSWORD = 'password'

#best solution to me for sending the current levels is a dict that has the pollutant as the key and the current level as the value 
#so after we parse the data from the database we would store it as the following 
#will change from sensor to sensor 
#example:
#current_levels = {
#	ozone : 0.03,
#	carbon_dioxide : 0.5,
#	particulate_matter_two_five : 0.001
#}

#Several options for sending alerts: 
#set constants for each max level of pollutants we monitor(more fitting for push notifications or texts)
MAX_OZONE = 0.1 #(in ppm)

#or send alert level (which i think is more fitting for email) 
#requires a level dict for each pollutant 
ozone_alert_level = { #also in ppm
	0.2 : "no more than 2 hours exposure", 
	0.1 : "8 hours per day exposure doing light work",
	0.08 : "8 hours per day exposure doing moderate work",
	0.05 : "8 hours per day exposure doing heavy work"
}

#or we can send alert for overall air quality marks rather than checking for a specfic pollutants level(also a good option for text/push notifications)
#we could do all of the above and let users select which type of notifications they would like to recieve 
#overall air quality might be difficult however because we might be missing stats on the top five pollutants used to calculate it 
#this requires a standard level dict (might be complicated to calculate bc of different units of measure & average time & calculation methods see: https://www.epa.vic.gov.au/your-environment/air/air-pollution/air-quality-index/calculating-a-station-air-quality-index)
#found a package that may be able to help with calculations https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/python-aqi/latest/python-aqi.pdf  
standard_level = {
	'ozone' : 100, #ppb
	'carbon_monoxide' : 9, #ppm
	'nitrogen_dioxide' : 120, #ppb 
	'particulate_matter_twofive' : 25, #Âµg/m3
	'sulfur_dioxide' : 200 #ppb 
}

#once we establish air qualtiy standards we want to use 
#this can be called at whatever interval we find fit (dont want to send an alert every time we find a high level bc of how often we are getting data) 
#may also want to include a timing portions like if ozone has been high for five or more checks of the sensor then send the emails
